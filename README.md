Ohoy! 

Iâ€™m interested in learning how to code and seeing if it could be a new career posibility for me.
I started somewhat in mars and haven't been coding before. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python on a basic level.

Feel free to give me tips! Would like to find good sources for learning, easy project ideas or a good community for motivation.

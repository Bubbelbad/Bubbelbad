Hey!

Iâ€™m interested in learning how to code and seeing if it could be a new career posibility for me.
I started in mars and haven't been coding previously. Interested in system development in the long run. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python & C# on a basic level
- âš¡ Hopefully getting into system developing education this autumn

Feel free to give me tips! Would appreciate ideas for learning or easy project that you've found helpful.
